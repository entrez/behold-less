Description
==

A Weechat plugin that allows you to move to a dedicated buffer, or hide
entirely, most spam messages from NetHack server announcement bots -- Beholder
in #hardfought and Rodney in #NetHack.


Manual Installation
==

Behold-less requires you to have a Weechat installation with Python 3 enabled.
Run the following to install:

curl -o ~/.weechat/python/behold-less.py \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/entrez/behold-less/master/behold-less.py
ln -s ~/.weechat/python/behold-less.py ~/.weechat/python/autoload/


Configuration
==

The rules for retaining messages in the regular channel can be customized via
a set of plugin options. These are set via Weechat:

    /set plugin.var.python.behold-less.<option>
